with lieaner queue  empty spaces which we get after performiming d-queue operations cant be used how ever it is very much possable when we make that linear queue and
this must be advantage of queue
#find out when rear will be greater then front 


AFTERNOON
Tree: In a tree nodes can have n number of children

4,5,6,7,9,13 are not having child

Binary tree: A Node can have max two childern.

 level order travel shell- 1,2,3,5,6 
 Note: we have to travers level by level strating from root proceeding from left to right

 tree travel cell
 1.Breath first search(BFS)
 2.Depth first search(DFS)
 Three types of dfs
 1.pri-order travel shell
 2.In-order travel shell
 3.post-order travel shell

Binary tree insertion:
we will do level order travel shell till we the find  an empty space.
in that empty space new node will be inserted.
